==========

All javascript tutorials

The set of codes hosted within are all the tutorials related and pertaining to HTML5 canvas. (There is one JQuery sample game too.)
The intent of the tutorial since june 2012 was not only to provide good quality readable code but also to increase and donate my learning curve for free to the world. Since readability was kept in mind there is also an explanation video for each of the code written by me. Hope you will find it helpful.

As a person systematically reads them one by one I too have enhanced the code for usage and compatability for all the browsers. The primary browser used for testing are Internet explorer 9/10/11 and Chrome. Firefox was used at some point where an issue was identified where object array allocation did not work as expected. The issue has been explained and rectified.

The following are the list of tutorials/simulation/animation available in this learning set.
a. HTML5 canvas moving 2D circle
b. HTML5 canvas 3D cube
c. HTML5 canvas 3D tube
d. HTML5 canvas 2D oscilloscope
e. HTML5 canvas 3D dominos (ground layer for object movement. Not an actual domino with image.)
f. HTML5 canvas 3D heart beat (heart shape)
g. HTML5 canvas 2D human walk
h. HTML5 canvas 2D A thousand stars browser performance (browser long term memory allocation management test)
i. HTML5 canvas 3D particle
j. HTML5 canvas 3D particle v2 (particle manipulation with better options and upgraded structure)
k. Jquery HTML game Hide me
